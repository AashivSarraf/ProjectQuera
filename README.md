# ProjectQuera
Developed a project named project quera in Java. 
Here students and faculties can register/login. Students of any branch can ask questions and those questions can be answered by faculty of the respective field. Further, the answers can be seen by that particular student of the branch who asked the question. Faculties can also upload documents and those documents comes in the visibility of the students of that specific branch.
I'm sharing a quick demo of the same. I hope you like it.
